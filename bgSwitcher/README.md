# Background Switcher Project

This project bulid by [React] [vite] and [tailwindcss]..
in this project i am try to chenge Background color

## Problam

- Background Switcher when i was make this project. then i know how to deal react dom with UI by the `useState()`.

`const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue)`

- `state` : current value of the state
- `setState` : function to update that value
- `useState()` : the value where we initial value like (e.g : number, sting, object, array, etc.. )
